      question:
        "What does it mean if the volume of fluid I drain decreases or if I do not drain any fluid?",
      answer:
        "If the fluid goes away suddenly or if the amount of drainage gradually declines, it is possible that the catheter or drainage line may be clogged. Squeeze the catheter and the drainage line gently. If drainage does not begin, follow the instructions for changing to another bottle. If the drainage does not start when you use a second bottle, call your doctor. If the amount of drainage gradually declines, the fluid may be drying up and it may be time for the catheter to be removed."

      question:
        "What if I still feel short of breath or experience discomfort after I have finished draining?",
      answer:

      question:
        "What should I do if the colour or appearance of the fluid changes from the usual colour?",
      answer:
        "Any change in the appearance of the fluid should be reported to your doctor."
    },
    {
      id: 5,
      question: "How will I know if my catheter is infected?",
      answer:
        "You should contact your doctor immediately if you believe your catheter is infected. You can use the X function to take a picture of the site and send it to your clinician. Pain, redness, warmth to touch, swelling, or fluid from around the catheter site, or a fever, may indicate your catheter is infected. Some discomfort and redness after insertion is expected but should not persist or worsen."

      id: 6,
      question: "Can I take a shower or bath with the catheter in place?",
      answer:
        "Shower: You can take a shower or sponge bath if a self-adhesive dressing like the one in the is securely attached to your skin. The self-adhesive dressing is designed to keep fluid out. Be sure the dressing is completely and securely attached and that the catheter and gauze pads are all contained underneath it. If the gauze becomes wet when showering, remove the dressing immediately, clean and dry the area, and apply a new dressing. Bath: Do not allow the catheter to soak underwater in a tub, bath, pool, etc"
